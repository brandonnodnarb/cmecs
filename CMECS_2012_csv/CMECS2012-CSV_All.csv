In which case, ""deep-water habits"" are those beyond the limit of occurrence of non-persistent emergents.",2012-06,A,1.2
Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,,,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting System,"The Estuarine System is defined by salinity and geomorphology. This System includes tidally influenced waters that (a) have an open-surface connection to the sea, (b) are regularly diluted by freshwater runoff from land, and (c) exhibit some degree of land enclosure. The Estuarine System extends upstream to the head of tide and seaward to the mouth of the estuary. Head of tide is identified in accordance with the Metadata Profile for Shoreline Data, FGDC-STD-001.2-2001 (FGDC 2001) as the inland or upstream limit of water affected by a tide of at least 0.2 foot (0.06 meter) amplitude. The mouth of the estuary is defined by an imaginary line connecting the seaward-most points of land that enclose the estuarine water mass at MLLW. Islands are included as headlands if they contribute significantly to the enclosure. Estuaries occur on continents or on islands and include waters of any depth. In CMECS they are defined as waters bounded by significant enclosure by land, having a direct connection to the sea and receiving measurable freshwater input to some part of the enclosed system during an average year. Salinity, a dimensionless conductivity ratio as measured on the practical salinity scale (PSS), was established by the IAPSO (International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans) in 1978 (UNESCO 1981), and is of prime importance in distinguishing freshwater from saline estuarine environments and differentiating among estuarine and marine environments of differing salinity. The range of salinity considered in the CMECS classification extends from zero to hyperhaline (>40). Oceanic salinities normally encountered throughout the world range from 30-40 on the PSS scale. Highly saline negative estuaries such as Laguna Madre and Florida Bay may experience salinity as high as 70-80. Extreme environments like the Dead Sea have salinity near 300. The tidally influenced part of the estuary may occur in a fresh reach where salinity is <0.5. According to FGDC-STD-004, this area would be classified within the Riverine System. However in CMECS, the Tidal Riverine area is considered to be an integral part of the ecology of the estuarine ecosystem, so it is classified within the Estuarine System instead.

The Estuarine System has four subsystems: Coastal, Open Water, Tidal Riverine Coastal, and Tidal Riverine Open Water.",2012-06,A,2
Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,Estuarine Coastal Subsystem,,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Estuarine Coastal Subsystem extends from the supratidal zone at the land margin up to the 4 meter depth contour in waters that have salinity greater than 0.5 (during the period of average annual low flow). The Estuarine Coastal Subsystem would be considered the shallow perimeter in a deeper estuary, although many estuaries may be entirely less than 4 meters deep and be classified as completely in the Coastal Subsystem. The 4 meter contour was selected as a cutoff between ""coastal"" and ""offshore"" estuarine waters because it identifies (somewhat arbitrarily) a region that is both shallow and generally in close proximity to the shore, making the substrate-to-water volume ratio here the highest in the entire estuary. A convening of experts delineated this 4 meter contour as described in Reilly, Spagnolo, and Ambrogio (1999) as important in both an ecological and a regulatory sense in estuarine systems and CMECS has adopted it to emphasize the significant human and natural processes that occur there. The high wetland-water ration and pelagic-benthic connectivity makes the Estuarine Coastal Subsystem an extremely dynamic and active area in terms of hydrodynamics, geology, and biology. It is this area in shallow coastal waters where maximum interaction between estuarine waters, and adjacent wetlands or developed shoreline occurs and often where intense juxtaposition of human activity and the natural system occurs. Watershed, point and non-point inputs to the estuary are often maximal in this shallow zone. Because the Coastal Subsystem tends to receive an abundance of light, these waters and bottom areas are usually sites of high primary production. In water columns, shallow waters typically support high phytoplankton productivity while shallow water bottoms are covered in highly productive microphytobenthos, macroalgae and/or rooted macrophytes and their attached epiphytic communities. As regions of high primary production, shallow waters attract an abundance of higher trophic level organisms that feed on plants and on their grazer communities. Strong physical subsidies from flowing waters and wind stresses create waves and currents that generally maintain the shallow waters in a well-oxidized state. Surface waters of the Coastal Subsystem tend to be well-mixed and are affected by strong physical processes that impact the bottom: resuspending sediments, reducing light and altering spectral characteristics of the light climate. The estuarine bottom in shallow waters is also subject to frequent wind-induced reworking and transport of sediments and dynamic bedforms.",2012-06,A,2.1

It does not include areas affected only by wind-driven spray, which may extend further inland.",2012-06,A,2.1.3
Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,Estuarine Open Water Subsystem,,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Estuarine Open Water Subsystem includes all waters of the Estuarine System with a total depth greater than 4 meters, exclusive of those waters designated Tidal Riverine Open Water. The Open Water Subsystem is subject to a number of physical factors that make it distinct from the Coastal Subsystem, including reduced air-water exchange, potentially reduced light at depth, reduced physical impact from waves and surface currents and reduced interaction between the water column and the bottom. Moreover, because of the formation of stratified layers in the Estuarine System, the Open Water Subsystem is often ""capped"" by a relatively strong density or stability gradient that distinctly separates the lower water column from the upper water column, separated by a zone of transition (such as a pycnocline, halocline, or thermocline). The Open Water Subsystem may be heterotrophic, because it often acts as a receiving basin for organic material settling from the shallower, better lit surface waters, especially when the waters are stratified and form shallow flanks of the water body. At times, this role as a heterotrophic zone may support high rates of respiration (relative to production) and therefore consume much of the available oxygen and lead to the formation of hypoxic or anoxic zones, generally in the deeper parts of these waters. Additionally, stratification and the mechanics of estuarine circulation often promote the formation of a salt wedge intrusion (from the marine environment) that renders the bottom waters more saline than waters in the surface layer above.",2012-06,A,2.2

Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,Estuarine Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem,,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Estuarine Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem includes the most upstream region of the estuary, in those areas between MHHW to the 4 meter depth contour below MLLW in waters that (a) can be regularly influenced by tides and (b) where salinity is below 0.5 during the period of annual low flow. The areas with this salinity may extend upriver to the head of tide, which is identified as the point where the mean tidal range becomes less than 0.2 feet (0.06 meters) (FGDC 2001). The Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem includes upstream areas that are influenced by ocean tides, but do not experience significant salinity. The hydraulic gradient is low and water stage and velocity fluctuate under tidal influence. Water is always present and is confined within a channel, and is usually flowing. The Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem is a critical part of the ecology and habitat of the estuary. This area is the site of significant ecological activity and a number of estuarine and coastal species depend on Tidal Riverine Coastal areas for breeding habitats, nursery habitats, and migratory pathways (e.g., striped bass, wading birds, and anadromous fishes). The Tidal Riverine Coastal Subsystem also supports unique hydrological features, for example the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum, tidal bores and Coriolis deflections.",2012-06,A,2.3

Aquatic Setting,Estuarine System,Estuarine Tidal Riverine Open Water Subsystem,,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Estuarine Tidal Riverine Open Water Subsystem includes tidal freshwater areas with a salinity of <0.5 and a depth of greater than 4 meters at MLLW. The Estuarine Tidal Riverine Open Water Subsystem is the most upstream portion of the estuary and subject to river and watershed influences, including high nutrient and sediment loads and low salinity. Similar to the Estuarine Open Water Subsystem, physical impact from waves and surface currents is reduced interaction at depth. This zone may be the site of the upper limit of the salt wedge and of a turbidity maximum zone, important as feeding and aggregation sites for plankton and benthic species. This zone is also potentially subject to high organic loading and formation of hypoxic waters. Primary production is often low, due to high turbidity and deep, dimly lighted water columns, especially in the river channel. For this reason, the Tidal Riverine Open Water Subsystem may be heterotrophic with net negative metabolic rates.",2012-06,A,2.4

Aquatic Setting,Marine System,,,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting System,"The Marine System is defined by salinity, which is typically about 35, although salinity can measure as low as 0.5 during the period of average annual low flow near fresh outflows. This system has little or no significant dilution from fresh water except near the mouths of estuaries and rivers. The Marine System includes all non-estuarine waters from the coastline to the central oceans. The landward boundary of this system is either the linear boundary across the mouth of an estuary or the limit of the supratidal splash zone affected by breaking waves. Seaward, the Marine System includes all ocean waters. The Marine System is typified by waves, currents and coastal water regimes determined by oceanic tides. Coastal indentations and bays that do not receive appreciable and regular freshwater inflow are part of the Marine System. Areas where river plumes discharge directly into marine waters without geomorphological enclosure are also part of the Marine System. In such areas, (e.g., Mississippi River plume, Chesapeake Bay plume), low salinity water and fresh plumes may discharge from the seaward boundary of the estuary, extending far into the Marine System beyond the enclosed part of the estuary. These freshwater features are considered to be Hydroforms within the Marine System (see Section 5). The Marine System has three subsystems (which are defined by depth): Nearshore, Offshore, and Oceanic.",2012-06,A,3
Aquatic Setting,Marine System,Marine Nearshore Subsystem,,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Marine Nearshore Subsystem extends from the landward limit of the Marine System to the 30 meter depth contour. The 30 meter depth contour was selected as a useful cutoff between shallower nearshore and deeper offshore waters. It is intended to represent an ecologically significant depth to which water column and benthic processes are strongly coupled in the Nearshore Subsystem. Surface currents and waves impinge the bottom at the storm wave base (Keen and Holland 2010) and vertical circulation generally distributes nutrients and sediments throughout the water column. The photic zone extends through the entire water column except in extreme cases (Kleypas, McManus and Menez 1999). The presence of nutrients and light support the growth of vegetation on the bottom including seagrass and macroalgal beds and 30 meters generally represents the depth to which most living coral is found.",2012-06,A,3.1

Aquatic Setting,Marine System,Marine Offshore Subsystem,,,,CMECS Setting: Aquatic Setting Subsystem,"The Marine Offshore Subsystem extends from the 30 meter depth contour to the continental shelf break, as defined by the maximum slope discontinuity with a rapid change in gradient of 3° or greater at the outer edge of the continental shelf. This shelf break boundary generally occurs between 100 - 200 meters depth. In the case of steep-sided, oceanic islands, where a continental shelf is not present, the offshore boundary of the Offshore Subsystem is defined at a bottom slope discontinuity occurring between 100 - 200 meters, or at 200 meters if no such discontinuity exists. The waters and benthos of the Offshore Subsystem are less coupled to each other and typically less influenced by terrigenous processes than in the Nearshore Subsystem. Distance from shore can vary greatly, depending on shelf morphology, and waters at the 30 meter isobath can be quite distant from the shore or may lie relatively close to land. The Offshore Subsystem may be strongly influenced by open-ocean biogeochemistry and physical processes. Often distinct water layers at the surface and bottom may be present. Because Offshore Subsystem waters are less influenced by coastal inputs, they generally are less turbid than those of the Nearshore Subsystem. Light penetration in the Offshore Subsystem can extend to significant depths and often reach the ocean bottom.",2012-06,A,3.2

Substrate Component,,,,,,CMECS Component: Substrate ,"Substrate is defined in CMECS as the non-living materials that form an aquatic bottom or seafloor, or that provide a surface (e.g., floating objects, buoys) for growth of attached biota. Substrate may be composed of any substance, natural or manmade. Describing the composition of the substrate is a fundamental part of any ecological classification scheme. Substrate provides context and setting for many aquatic processes, and it provides living space for benthic and attached biota. The Substrate Component (SC) is a characterization of the composition and particle size of the surface layers of the substrate; this component is designed to be compatible with a range of sampling tools. The SC provides guidance to characterize the layers of substrate that support the majority of multicellular life – the upper layer of hard substrate, or (typically) the upper 15 centimeters of soft substrate – in a way that is consistent with a variety of past practices. The SC and the BC describe the non-living (SC) and living (BC) aspects of a plan-view perspective of the seafloor at comparable scales. SC observational unit scales range from sediment corers or grabs, to sediment profile or plan-view photographs of the seafloor, to defined quadrats or transects, to video clips, to high-resolution acoustic images. At larger scales, the structure, shape, and surface pattern of substrate features are described by the Geoform Component (GC).",2012-06,S,

Substrate Component,Biogenic Substrate,,,,,CMECS Substrate Component: Substrate Origin,"Substrates where percent cover of non-living Biogenic Substrate exceeds percent cover of both Geologic Substrate and Anthropogenic Substrates, when all are considered separately. Biogenic substrates are classified at the higher levels by taxonomy, and at the lower levels by median particle size—using the units Reef Substrate (> 4,096 millimeters), Rubble (64 millimeters to < 4,096 millimeters), Hash (2 millimeters to < 64 millimeters), and Sand (0.0625 millimeters to < 2 millimeters). These units are derived from Wentworth (1922), and they can be broken down into Wentworth grain size classes for greater precision, if desired. Biogenic Substrate classifications may be based on percent weight (e.g., for retrieved samples); percent cover (e.g., for plan-view images); and visual percent composition (for other approaches). The terms ""dominant"" and ""primarily"" in the Biogenic Substrate Origin describe the substrate type that is present in the greatest percent cover, greatest percent weight, or greatest visual percent composition. When two Biogenic Substrate types are present, ""dominant"" and ""primarily"" are equivalent to ""> 50%"". When three or more types exist, the dominant type may occur at a lower percent-of-total value.

When two Anthropogenic Substrate types are present, ""dominant"" and ""primarily"" are equivalent to ""> 50%"".

Biotic Component,,,,,,CMECS Component: Biotic ,"The Biotic Component (BC) of CMECS is a classification of the living organisms of the seabed and water column together with their physical associations at a variety of spatial scales. The BC is organized into a branched hierarchy of five nested levels: biotic setting, biotic class, biotic subclass, biotic group, and biotic community (Table 8.1). The biotic setting indicates whether the biota are attached or closely associated with the benthos or are suspended or floating in the water column. Biotic classes and biotic subclasses describe major biological characteristics at a fairly coarse level. Biotic groups are descriptive terms based on finer distinctions of taxonomy, structure, position, environment, and salinity levels. Biotic communities are descriptions of repeatable, characteristic assemblages of organisms. In the absence of complete species association data, biotic communities can be approximated using dominant or diagnostic species and then refined once more information is available. When identified in the context of repeating environmental circumstances, biotic communities can be used as the basis for defining and fully describing biotopes. A biotope assigns a more complete description of the feature; involving all other applicable components of CMECS, listing the defining species and explaining the ecological and societal values of the biotope (see Section 9).
Unless otherwise noted, biotic classification units in the BC are defined by the dominance of life forms, taxa, or other classifiers in an observation. For collected observations (such as grab samples or cores), dominance is measured in terms of biomass or numbers of individuals, as specified by the user. In the case of images and visual estimates, dominance is assigned to the taxa with the greatest percent cover in the observational footprint. For example, an observation with 60% seagrass, 20% soft corals, and 20% sponges is classified as an Aquatic Vegetation Bed—whereas an observation with 60% soft corals, 20% seagrass, and 20% sponges is classified as a Faunal Bed. It may be important for some users to note the presence of the non-dominant biota, which can be achieved by using a Co-occurring Element in an observation. See Section 10 for information about how to note Co-occurring Elements and Associated Taxa.",2012-06,B,
Biotic Component,Planktonic Biota,,,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Setting,"Planktonic Biota includes biota that drift, float, or remain suspended in the water column in aggregations that are big enough to be (a) detected by the human eye (or with mild magnification) or (b) sampled with a fine-plankton net. Planktonic biota are not regularly associated with the seafloor. Water parcels may be examined for plankton using a dipnet, a water sampler, a towed plankton net, imagery (including ""Plankton Cameras"" that are moved through the water), or other means. In all cases, plankton are assigned classifications based on perceived dominance by the observer (either based on mass or numbers, as specified by the user/observer). Because most plankton communities are mixes of many types of zooplankton and phytoplankton, practitioners should consider the widespread use of the Co-occurring Elements modifier (when non-dominant taxa are covered in other parts of the CMECS classification) or the Associated Taxa modifier (when non-dominant taxa do not constitute a CMECS classification unit).",2012-06,B,1
Biotic Component,Planktonic Biota,Zooplankton,,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Class,"Water parcels or layers in which zooplankton are perceived to be the dominant feature. Zooplankton are heterotrophic biota of the water column; zooplankton drift with the currents, but may (or may not) be able to move through the water under their own power. Zooplankton may feed on phytoplankton, other zooplankton, or on detritus. CMECS classifies zooplankton that may range in size from gigantic salp chains (strings of gelatinous filter feeding tunicates that attain a length of 30 meters or more), to radiolarians (minute, shelled amoebas). CMECS was not designed to be used for the smallest planktonic forms (nanoplankton or picoplankton). CMECS Class Zooplankton includes both Holoplankton (that live out their entire life histories in the plankton) and Meroplankton (that are transient in the plankton). Meroplankton are typically larval stages that develop into nekton or benthos as they mature. Meroplankton in general are difficult to identify; specialized taxonomic knowledge and sets of regional keys are generally required. Both Holoplankton and Meroplankton are quite diverse and include members of most marine phyla.

Aggregations of specific types of zooplankton (or of mixed zooplankton/phytoplankton communities) may occur in many forms. In general, an ""Aggregation"" is a relatively dense and homogeneous group of plankton that may be produced by rapid reproduction in-place under favorable conditions (by phytoplankton and holoplankton), by hydrodynamic forcing, by a common mass origin, by plankton motility (e.g., diurnal vertical migrations), by barriers to movement (e.g., pycnoclines), or by other phenomena. A Spawning Aggregation forms after a mass spawning event when synchronous spawning by many individuals produces large pulses of gametes and larvae. Classification of a Spawning Aggregation requires some evidence of recent mass spawning. Aggregations of all types may occur as amorphously shaped packets of water, may occur in layers at various depths, and may occur as diurnal migrations, among other forms.",2012-06,B,1.1

(2) Blooms are defined as rapid growth and multiplication of single species to high density in an area of surface waters within a short period of time (days), often to the exclusion of other species.

(3) Phytoplankton maxima layers are expressed as defined layers of one or more species, often with one group predominating, that form at depth within the water column, whose thickness is small relative to its areal extent.

Biotic Component,Planktonic Biota,Phytoplankton,Cryptophyte Phytoplankton,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Water parcels or layers in which zooplankton are perceived to be the dominant feature. Zooplankton are heterotrophic biota of the water column; zooplankton drift with the currents, but may (or may not) be able to move through the water under their own power. Zooplankton may feed on phytoplankton, other zooplankton, or on detritus. CMECS classifies zooplankton that may range in size from gigantic salp chains (strings of gelatinous filter feeding tunicates that attain a length of 30 meters or more), to radiolarians (minute, shelled amoebas). CMECS was not designed to be used for the smallest planktonic forms (nanoplankton or picoplankton). CMECS Class Zooplankton includes both Holoplankton (that live out their entire life histories in the plankton) and Meroplankton (that are transient in the plankton). Meroplankton are typically larval stages that develop into nekton or benthos as they mature. Meroplankton in general are difficult to identify; specialized taxonomic knowledge and sets of regional keys are generally required. Both Holoplankton and Meroplankton are quite diverse and include members of most marine phyla.

Aggregations of specific types of zooplankton (or of mixed zooplankton/phytoplankton communities) may occur in many forms. In general, an ""Aggregation"" is a relatively dense and homogeneous group of plankton that may be produced by rapid reproduction in-place under favorable conditions (by phytoplankton and holoplankton), by hydrodynamic forcing, by a common mass origin, by plankton motility (e.g., diurnal vertical migrations), by barriers to movement (e.g., pycnoclines), or by other phenomena. A Spawning Aggregation forms after a mass spawning event when synchronous spawning by many individuals produces large pulses of gametes and larvae. Classification of a Spawning Aggregation requires some evidence of recent mass spawning. Aggregations of all types may occur as amorphously shaped packets of water, may occur in layers at various depths, and may occur as diurnal migrations, among other forms.",2012-06,B,1.3.4

The density gradients and discontinuity at the surface of the water column or at fronts and discontinuities within the water column are ideal for the aggregation of microbes in films covering large areas and strands that follow the movements of water currents (Cunliffe and Murrell 2009). The concentration of microbes creates numerous niches for feeding by higher trophic levels and for the processing of biogenic and inorganic compounds that are important to marine chemistry, including controlling carbon, nitrogen and sulfur redox processes (Hansel and Francis 2006).

Biotic Component,Planktonic Biota,Floating/Suspended Microbes,Microbial Foam,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Aggregations of microbes within the foam matrix that forms on the water's surface. Sea foam is the foam the lies on the sea surface, in the surf zone and at times on intertidal areas, created from dissolved organic compounds when air is forcefully injected into the water column (Harden and Williams 1989). Foam formation is aided by properties of lignans, proteins and carbohydrates that act as surfactants or foaming agents. The large area presented by the micro-bubbles composing seafoam is an ideal surface for concentration and adherence of microbial communities including bacteria, viruses and microscopic plankton. The characteristics of the air-water interface, and particularly of sea foam are unique compared to the bulk water column (Lion and Leckie 1981) and possess unique physical and chemical properties. The foams are well-oxygenated, sites of photolytic processes and tend to support high levels of aerobic metabolism with high organic processing rates. Surface foam is the site of intense trophic activity at the microbial level because of the concentration of microbial biomass, sugars, lipids and other growth compounds and thus represents an important part of the marine microbial food web. Concentration and transformation of trace metals, nutrient compounds, contaminants and pollutants also occurs in sea foam and can enter the food web via microbial pathways.

The living coral reef is characterized by the presence of live reef-forming corals, but may or may not be dominated by living corals; other fauna may in fact exceed the corals in percent cover.
The Deep-Water/Cold-Water Coral Reefs are separated into two Biotic Groups based on whether they are formed by stony corals or stylasterid corals. The growth forms of those corals and the reefs they create are structurally different. Biotic communities are characterized by the dominant species of framework-forming, deep-sea coral.

Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Faunal Bed,,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Class,"Seabeds dominated or characterized by a cover of animals that are closely associated with the bottom, including attached, clinging, sessile, infaunal, burrowing, laying, interstitial, and slow-moving animals, but not animals that have created substrate (Reef Biota). Unlike Reef Biota, Faunal Bed biota cannot (or are not sufficiently abundant to) construct identifiable substrate. ""Slow-moving"" animals included in the Faunal Bed class are defined as being incapable of moving outside the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Faunal Bed organisms are aquatic, but they may be able to withstand periods of exposure to air.
Faunal Bed food webs may receive basic trophic inputs from benthic photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, plankton, allochthonous detritus and debris, or other sources. In nature, Faunal Bed habitats are often composed of complex mixes and associations of animals of different phyla, sizes, feeding strategies, and habits, and these areas can be difficult to classify. Faunal Bed classifications are determined in CMECS by greatest percent cover of fauna or faunal structures, or (particularly for infauna) by estimates of greatest biomass. The inherent complexity of these areas is addressed through Co-occurring Elements and Associated Taxa Modifiers (Sections 10.6.2 and 10.3.1).
In the photic zone, primary producers often constitute the greatest biotic percent cover of substrate, and so define the biotic group of an area (e.g., Filamentous Algal Bed, Microphytobenthos). Faunal Bed organisms, when present in these areas, are classified in CMECS as Co-occurring Elements, for example: ""Biotic Group: Coralline/Crustose Algal Bed with Co-occurring Element: <Strongylocentrotus purpurata>"".
In waters deeper than the photic zone, however, most Faunal Bed biotic groups and communities are defined by immobile or slow-moving suspension-feeders and detritivores that dominate percent cover or biomass, and create a distinct living environment for other fauna. Other Faunal Bed biotic groups and communities are defined by slow-moving grazers or predators (e.g., urchins, starfish), when these are the clearly dominant fauna. However, practitioners should attempt to identify a biotic group that is providing ""forage"" for these predatory or herbivorous species. If a ""forage"" biotope is present, it will often dominate percent cover, and practitioners should characterize the area accordingly as (for example): ""Biotic Community: Nassariid Bed with Co-occurring Element: <Pisaster>"". The Co-occurring Elements modifier (see Section 10.6.2) is used to describe areas where any two (or more) biotic groups, biotic communities, or other biotic classification units described in CMECS occur simultaneously. In these cases, the classification units exist together, as a mix, in a single location, and the non-dominant units are termed Co-occurring Elements. Further local research may indicate that the mix of biotic groups and co-occurring elements is, in fact, a repeatable unit that should be designated as a single defined biotic group or biotope.
Other common animals in seafloor environments include opportunistic predators or herbivores that are capable of moving outside the bounds of the classification unit within one day, such as portunid crabs, cancrid crabs, horseshoe crabs, cephalopods, other mobile benthic crustaceans, fishes, and other nekton. These animals actively move over the seafloor searching for prey, and are defined in CMECS as Associated Taxa (see Section 10.3.1).
As in other BC classes, practitioners may apply Genus and/or species names to define local biotic communities that are not listed in the current version of CMECS. In these cases, observations in the field must verify that these new biotic communities are predictable and repeating aggregations or assemblages of dominant or characteristic species. These names should be submitted as part of the CMECS Dynamic Content Standard (see Section 13).",2012-06,B,2.2
Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Faunal Bed,Attached Fauna,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Areas characterized by rock substrates, gravel substrates, other hard substrates, or mixed substrates that are dominated by fauna which maintain contact with the substrate surface, including firmly attached, crawling, resting, interstitial, or clinging fauna. Fauna may be found on, between, or under rocks or other hard substrates or substrate mixes. These fauna use pedal discs, cement, byssal threads, feet, claws, appendages, spines, suction, negative density, or other means to stay in contact with the (generally) hard substrate, and may or may not be capable of slow movement over the substrate. However, these fauna are not able to achieve speeds sufficient to move beyond the unit boundary within one day. Many attached fauna are suspension feeders and feed from the water column. Other attached fauna are benthic feeders, including herbivores, predators, detritivores, and omnivores. Within Attached Fauna, the Biotic Group is identified as the biota making up the greatest percent cover on the hard attachment surface within the classified area. Biota present at lesser percent cover values within the classified area may be identified as Co-occurring Elements (See Section 10.6.2) or (if not a CMECS Biotic Group) Associated Taxa (See Section 10.3.1).",2012-06,B,2.2.1

Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Faunal Bed,Soft Sediment Fauna,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Areas that are characterized by fine unconsolidated substrates (sand, mud) and that are dominated in percent cover or in estimated biomass by infauna, sessile epifauna, mobile epifauna, mobile fauna that create semi-permanent burrows as homes, or by structures or evidence associated with these fauna (e.g., tilefish burrows, lobster burrows). These animals may tunnel freely within the sediment or embed themselves wholly or partially in the sediment. In many cases, they will regularly leave their burrows, and may move rapidly or swim actively after doing so, but any animal that creates a semi-permanent home in the sediment can be classified as Soft Sediment Fauna. These animals may also move slowly over the sediment surface, but are not capable of moving outside of the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Most of these fauna possess specialized organs for burrowing, digging, embedding, tube-building, anchoring, or locomotory activities in soft substrates. Biotic communities in the Soft Sediment Fauna subclass are identified with the term ""Bed"", to distinguish them from Attached Fauna biotic communities (which do not include the term ""Bed"").
Within Soft Sediment Fauna, the Biotic Group is identified as the biota making up the greatest percent cover or the greatest estimated biomass within the classified area. Biota present at lesser percent cover or estimated biomass values within the classified area may be identified as Co-occurring Elements (See Section 10.6.2) or (if not a CMECS Biotic Group) as Associated Taxa (See Section 10.3.1). Associated Taxa include rapid epifaunal predators such as crustaceans, fishes, and other nekton that are capable of leaving the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Associated Taxa may be capable of digging into the sediment surface to feed or hide (e.g., portunid crabs) but do not construct a semi-permanent burrow as would define Soft Sediment Fauna. For practitioners who wish to better characterize Soft Sediment Fauna, the Community Successional Stage Modifier (Section 10.3.2, including Figure 10.1 and Table 10.3) is a helpful addition to classifying soft sediment fauna, and can be applied to almost every soft-sediment area.

Diverse mixes of fauna are common, and biotic communities may or may not be identifiable with an abundant or distinctive dominant taxon. Large fecal casts, mounds, burrows, feeding voids, etc., may be taken as evidence of deep-burrowing fauna. However, areas characterized by larger, tube-building worms (that construct a significant tube structure rising above the sediment-water interface, but may live with a body position below the sediment surface) are classified as Larger Tube-Building Fauna.

In some soft sediment locations, basket stars form large entangled aggregations consisting of many individuals and covering large areas. Most basket stars are suspension feeders, but some species are more omnivorous or predaceous.",2012-06,B,2.2.2.9

Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Aquatic Vegetation Bed,Benthic Macroalgae,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Aquatic beds dominated by macroalgae attached to the substrate, such as kelp (Figure 8.14), intertidal fucoids, and calcareous algae. Macroalgal communities can exist at all depths within the photic zone, on diverse substrates, and across a range of energy and water chemistry regimes. In the CMECS framework, macroalgae that dominate the benthic environment and form a vegetated cover fall within this subclass. Macroalgal communities (typically coralline/crustose algae) that build substrate in a reef setting are categorized in the BC Reef Biota Class instead.
Many macroalgal types and communities have low temporal persistence and can bloom and die-back within short periods. This aspect of macroalgae is reflected with the temporal persistence modifier, which allows further description of the units in this subclass.
While many researchers organize macroalgae based on their pigmentation, CMECS takes a growth morphology approach to defining benthic algal biotic groups. This decision was driven by the fact that macroalgal assemblages often include a variety of co-existing algal species, making delineations of individual species difficult. This approach also captures the influence that the algal growth structure has in shaping the local environment- by providing shelter, shade, and detrital material to an area, which is important to associated fauna.
The Biotic Group level of classification here is a modification of the ""Littler functional-form model"" for marine macroalgae, as described by Littler, Littler, and Taylor (1983) and promoted by Lobban and Harrison (1997). The Littler functional form groups are the sheet group, filamentous group, coarsely branched group, thick leathery group, jointed calcareous group, and crustose group. Littler, Littler, and Taylor (1983) discuss the morphological, metabolic, and ecological significance of each group, and they point out that these groups are best considered as recognizable points along a continuum (rather than as discrete bins). Biotic Groups and Communities defined by macroalgae generally also include a diversity of associated fauna, including many that consume macroalgae (e.g., sea urchins and mollusks); these may be characterized as Modifiers: Associated Taxa, or Co-occurring Elements.",2012-06,B,2.5.1

These microalgal species have a high diversity (more than 100 species in the western Atlantic), although only 30 - 50 species commonly occur at one time. There is a high turnover of individual turf algal species seasonally; only a few species are able to persist or remain abundant throughout the year. But turf algae- when observed as a functional group- remain relatively stable year round (Steneck and Dethier 1994), and they are often able to recover rapidly after being partially consumed by herbivores. Turfs are capable of trapping ambient sediment, and they kill corals by gradual encroachment.",2012-06,B,2.5.1.8

Seagrass beds (Figure 8.15) may occur in true marine salinities, and they may extend into the lower salinity zones of estuaries.

Seagrass beds are complex structural habitats that provide refuge and foraging opportunities for abundant and diverse faunal communities in shallow waters. Seagrass beds require a specific set of ecological conditions for success, and they are generally perceived as areas of high environmental quality.

Biotic Component,Benthic/Attached Biota,Emergent Wetland,Emergent Tidal Marsh,,,CMECS Biotic Component: Biotic Subclass,"Communities dominated by emergent, halophytic, herbaceous vegetation (with occasional woody forbs or shrubs) along low-wave-energy, intertidal areas of estuaries and rivers.

Biotic communities in this subclass are equivalent to National Vegetation Classification Associations of FGDC-STD-005-2008, and follow their naming conventions (FGDC 2008). However, FGDC-STD-005-2008 does not split marshes into ""herbaceous"" or ""scrub-shrub"" at their Group level. As a result, some of the names of FGDC-STD-005-2008 types (which correspond to the CMECS Emergent Wetland class) indicate that the biotic community is a ""Dwarf-shrubland."" These specific communities are dominated by woody forbs, which- while technically dwarf-shrubs- function more like herbaceous vegetation. These types were included in Emergent Tidal Marsh, because their total floristics and physiognomy indicate an herbaceous marsh setting.

Vegetation in this subclass is composed of emergent aquatic macrophytes, especially halophytic species- chiefly graminoids (such as rushes, reeds, grasses and sedges), shrubs, and other herbaceous species (such as broad-leaved emergent macrophytes, rooted floating-leaved and submergent species [aquatic vegetation], and macroscopic algae). The vegetation is usually arranged in distinct zones of parallel patterns, which occur in response to gradients of tidal flooding frequency and duration, water chemistry, or other disturbances.

Tides may expose mudflats that contain a sparse mix of pioneering forb and graminoid species. Salinity levels (which control many aspects of salt-marsh chemistry) vary depending on a complexity of factors, including frequency of inundation, rainfall, soil texture, freshwater influence, fossil salt deposits, and more. Salt marshes often grade into (or are intermixed with) scrub-shrub wetlands in higher areas. See Figure 8.16 for an example of an emergent tidal marsh.",2012-06,B,2.6.1

Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic Group.

Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs.

Dwarf shrub and short mangroves are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Shrubland Biotic Group.

Mangrove Forests (e.g., mangal or mangle) occur along the sheltered coasts of tropical latitudes of the Earth, and are commonly found on the intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries, usually in the region between the salt marshes and seagrass beds and may extend inland along river courses where tidal amplitude is high. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs.

Geoform Component,,,,,,CMECS Component: Geoform ,"In CMECS, the geological context—and associated features of the landscape and seascape—are captured in the Geoform Component (GC), which describes the physical structure of the environment across multiple scales. The GC addresses five aspects of the coastal and seafloor morphology: tectonic setting, physiographic setting, geoform origin, geoform, and geoform type. The framework for the GC adopts most of the structures described by Greene et al. (2007) and the estuary types outlined in Madden et al. (2008), but expands the options to include a larger number of coastal and nearshore features.
The GC is not intended to be a geological classification per se. Rather, it provides a way to present the structural aspects of the physical environment that are relevant to—and drivers of—biological community distribution. This component does not include surface geology attributes [such as hardbottom, softbottom, sand, gravel, and cobble as in Greene et al. (2007)], because these attributes are included in the Substrate Component that describes the character and composition of the seafloor. Used together, geoform and substrate component units reflect the physical environment in which benthic/attached biota occurs.
The GC is organized into four subcomponents that occur along a spatial continuum (Table 6.1): tectonic setting and physiographic setting describe large, global features, while the level 1 and level 2 geoform subcomponents describe meso-and microscale units (extending down to features at the meter scale). Each subcomponent has a general scale range associated with it, but features within these categories will naturally overlap one another—because of the natural gradients and transitions between geologic units and processes. Similarly, regional differences in processes will cause units to respond differently on spatial and temporal scales (Harris et al. 2005).",2012-06,G,
Geoform Component,Tectonic Setting ,,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent,"At the largest scales, the GC is divided into eight planetary features that reflect global tectonic processes (both past and present). Generally, these features are thousands of square kilometers or larger in size. They include both continental and oceanic crustal units, and the tectonic setting features form the context for all of the smaller-scale geoforms.",2012-06,G,t
Geoform Component,Tectonic Setting,Abyssal Plain,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A flat region of the deep ocean floor (with a slope less than 1:1,000) that was formed by the deposition of pelagic and gravity-current sediments, which obscure the pre-existing topography.

Geoform Component,Tectonic Setting,Mid-Ocean Ridge,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"An extremely large, global spreading center. The mid-ocean ridge is a continuous, seismically active, median mountain range extending through the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian, and South Pacific Oceans. It is a broad, fractured swell with a central rift valley and usually extremely rugged topography. The ridge is 1-3 kilometers in height, about 1,500 kilometers in width, and over 84,000 kilometers in length. Sections of this feature are sometimes named based on the ocean region in which this feature occur (for example, Mid-Atlantic Ridge).",2012-06,G,t6

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Barrier Reef,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A long, narrow coral reef, roughly parallel to the shore and separated from it by a lagoon of considerable depth and width. This reef may enclose a volcanic island (either wholly or in part), or it may lie a great distance from a continental coast (such as the Great Barrier Reef).

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Fjord,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A long, narrow, glacially eroded inlet or arm of the sea. They are often U-shaped, steep-walled, and deep. Because of their depth, they tend to have low surface-area-to-volume ratios. They have moderate watershed-to-water-area ratios and low-to-moderate riverine inputs. Fjords often have a geologic sill formation at the seaward end caused by glacial action. This morphology- combined with a low exchange of bottom waters with the ocean- can result in formation of hypoxic bottom waters.",2012-06,G,p10
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Inland/Enclosed Sea,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A large, water body almost completely surrounded by land. Salinities range from fresh through marine. The term inland is used to describe situations where the water body is connected to an adjacent large water body by a narrow strait, channel, canal, or river. Examples of this type of setting are the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The Great Lakes, due to their connectivity to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River also fall into this category.",2012-06,G,p11
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Lagoonal Estuary,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"This class of estuary tends to be shallow, highly enclosed, and have reduced exchange with the ocean. They often experience high evaporation, and they tend to be quiescent in terms of wind, current, and wave energy. Lagoonal estuaries usually have a very high surface-to-volume ratio, a low-to-moderate watershed-to-water-area ratio, and can have a high wetland-to-water ratio. The flushing times tend to be long relative to riverine estuaries and embayments because the restricted exchange with the marine-end member and the reduced river input lengthen residence times. As such, there tends to be more benthic-pelagic interaction, enhanced by generally shallow bathymetry. Additionally, exchange with surrounding landscapes (often riparian wetland and palustrine systems) tends to be enhanced and more highly coupled than in other types of estuaries.

Occasionally, a lagoon may be produced by the temporary sealing of a river estuary by a barrier. Such lagoons are usually seasonal and exist until the river breaches the barrier; these lagoons occur in regions of low or sporadic rainfall.",2012-06,G,p12
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Major River Delta,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"The nearly flat, alluvial tract of land at the mouth of a river, which commonly forms a triangular or fan-shaped plain. It is crossed by many distributaries, and the delta is the result of sediment accumulation from the river. Deltas are distinguished from alluvial fans by their flatter slope. Examples of this feature include the Mississippi Delta, the Nile Delta, and the Ganges Delta. All deltas are dynamic areas of mixed-water flow and salinity.",2012-06,G,p13
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Marine Basin Floor,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"Basin floors refer broadly to the areas of the seafloor between the base of the continental margin (usually the foot of the continental rise) and the mid-ocean ridge.

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Ocean Bank/Plateau,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"A mound-like or ridge-like elevated area on the seafloor; it may have a modest-to-substantial extent. Although submerged, this feature can reach close to sea level (e.g., Bahama Banks).",2012-06,G,p15
Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Riverine Estuary,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"This class of estuary tends to be linear and seasonally turbid (especially in upper reaches), and it can be subjected to high current speeds. These estuaries are sedimentary and depositional, so they may be associated with a delta, bar, barrier island, and other depositional features. These estuaries also tend to be highly flushed (with a wide and variable salinity range) and seasonally stratified. Riverine estuaries have moderate surface-to-volume ratios with a high watershed-to-water-area ratio- and they can have very high wetland-to-water-area ratios as well. These estuaries are often characterized by a V-shaped channel configuration and a salt wedge.

High inputs of land drainage can promote increased primary productivity, which may be confined to the water column in the upper reach, due to low transparency in the water column. Surrounding wetlands may be extensive and healthy, given the sediment supply and nutrient input. This marsh perimeter may be important in taking up the excess nutrients that are introduced to the system. Physically, the system may tend to be stratified during periods of high riverine input, and the input of marine waters may be enhanced by countercurrent flow.",2012-06,G,p16

Geoform Component,Physiographic Setting,Trench,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Setting ,"Trenches in the physiographic setting subcomponent occur at a smaller spatial scale than the hemispheric-sized trenches in the tectonic setting. Both types of trenches share similar morphology, but physiographic setting Trenches are not necessarily associated with plate subduction.",2012-06,G,p21
Geoform Component,Geoform,,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent,"Geoforms are physical, coastal and seafloor structures that are generally no larger than hundreds of square kilometers in size. This size determination may be an areal extent or a linear distance. Larger geoforms (Level 1) are generally larger than one square kilometer, and correspond to Megahabitats in the Greene et al. classification system (2007). These features can be defined using geologic or geomorphic maps and bathymetric images of the seafloor at map scales of 1:250,000 or less. Smaller geoforms (Level 2) are generally less than one square kilometer in size (or less than 1 kilometer in distance); and correspond to Meso-and Macro-habitats in the Greene et al. system. Level 2 geoforms (such as individual coral reefs, tide pools, and sand wave fields) can be identified through in-situ observational methods (such as underwater videography) or through low-altitude, high-resolution optical or acoustic remote sensing.
Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms are arranged as two separate subcomponents so that they can be used in tandem to describe complex spatial patterns of geoform structures. Level 2 geoforms normally occur as portions of—or smaller features contained (nesting) within— Level 1 geoforms, but are not hierarchically constrained by the Level 1 geoforms. It is possible for geoforms at either level to nest within other units within their same level (for example, a Level 2 pockmark may occur within a Level 2 shoal/bar as in Figure 6.1 below). Although Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms are considered different subcomponents because of their scale differences, they share the same hierarchical structure and some units are found in both levels (if they occur over a broad range of sizes). For brevity, we have combined the definitions of these units into one listing and have indicated the subcomponent(s) in which they reside.
Geoform types are varieties of geoforms that provide further information on morphology and physical processes underway at any individual geoform. Users are encouraged to apply the Type designations where applicable—but they are not required to use it if their data do not support this level of detail. Users are also encouraged to provide the full nesting (recording of upper-level attributes) for any geoforms they identify, although there will be many instances where this is not practical.",2012-06,G,g

Geoform Component,Geoform,Anthropogenic Geoform,,,,CMECS Geoform Subcomponent: Origin,"In many coastal and deep oceans, artificial structures (such as piers, breakwaters, bulkheads, berms, drilling rigs, and artificial reefs) are a significant part of the environment. The continually (or intermittently) submerged portions of features attract vagile fauna and provide attachment surfaces for plants and sessile animals. These features can also provide shelter from predators and prevailing current, and they can support niche communities that increase overall biodiversity. However, these structures can also have negative effects (such as altering natural hydrodynamic patterns, interfering with animal movement, and increasing contaminant loading into nearshore areas), and thus are often of interest to resource managers.

The same relationship between Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms prevails in this origin type as in the geologic and biogenic categories; however, due to the complexity of some of the anthropogenic structures, many more Level 2 units may be present in a single Level 1 geoform.

Water Column Component,,,,,,CMECS Component: Water Column ,"The Water Column Component (WC) describes the water column environment of estuaries and oceans.The water column presents unique challenges to classification and characterization—due to its three-dimensional structure; a high degree of temporal variability; a wide, dynamic range in environmental characteristics (across multiple spatial scales); and the inherent challenges of measuring the various parameters. The WC identifies the structures, patterns, properties, and processes, of the water column relevant to ecological relationships and habitat-organism interactions. This component extends from the land-sea margin to the deep oceans and vertically from the surface of the water to the benthic interface. The WC encompasses the Lacustrine, Estuarine, and Marine Systems. The water column component of the Lacustrine System will be fully addressed in a later document, while the latter two systems are described here.
Because the water column is highly variable in both time and space, it is difficult to assign structures or properties to a specific location or depth with certainty. The characteristics of the water continuously change over time. For example, in the clear waters of the open ocean, the well-lit zone of photosynthesis generally extends throughout the upper 200 meters of the water column. In estuaries and coastal waters, surface conditions and water constituents reduce the depth of the photic zone by orders of magnitude. Nearshore photic depths can be quite shallow and variable from place to place or over short time periods. In shallow waters, optical dynamics are compressed in the vertical dimension and their effects are amplified—strongly influencing biota in the water column and in the benthos.
The WC is designed to accommodate the high degree of spatio-temporal variability of the water column with a simple and flexible structure and a comprehensive array of units and modifiers. The WC provides a way to define and organize key information most commonly required to characterize the water column. Spatially, the WC can be applied to points or profiles within the water column, as well as to water masses, regions, entire water bodies and entire oceans.
The WC contains five subcomponents that can be used alone or in combination (Table 5.1): Layer, Salinity, Temperature, Hydroform and Biogeochemical Feature. The Layer subcomponent indicates vertical position within the water column, using a set of defined layers associated with each subsystem and gives information about relative proximity to the atmosphere, mid-depth or benthos. Units in the Salinity and Temperature subcomponents describe the salinity and temperature characteristics of a water parcel within standard ranges. Hydroform Classes, their hydroforms, and hydroform types describe physical hydrographic features such as currents, waves, water masses, gyres, upwellings and fronts. The Biogeochemical Features subcomponent describes such phenomena as biofilm, thermocline and turbidity maximum—features of the water column that include properties and constituents beyond simple hydrodynamics. Modifiers can be selected from a comprehensive list and applied to any component to define additional characteristics such as trophic status, oxygen status, tide regime and energy regime.",2012-06,W,
Water Column Component,Water Column Layer ,,,,,CMECS Water Column Subcomponent,"The Water Column Layer Subcomponent resolves the water column vertically into its major coherent layers based on position relative to the surface and to the pycnocline or mid-depth. These layers reflect ecologically important characteristics of the water column structure. The layers for all cross-shelf waters include Surface Layer, Upper Water Column, Pycnocline and Lower Water Column. In the Marine Oceanic Subsystem, additional divisions (described below) are based on depth in the water column. The Layer subcomponent works with the Subsystem of the Aquatic Setting described in Section 4 to define the estuarine and marine water column as a grid. The grid framework is composed of horizontal regions (x-y axes) divided on the basis of position relative to land and total water depth, and vertical layers (z-axis) defined by depth below the surface. This structural arrangement provides a fixed frame of reference for describing position within the water column and accommodates the variability in water column features, conditions and movements by applying additional subcomponents (Figure 5.1).
One set of Water Column Layers is defined for application to all Estuarine Subsystems and the two Marine Subsystems (Nearshore and Offshore) in cross shelf waters where the total water depth is relatively shallow.
For all subsystems (except the Marine Oceanic) the following Water Column Layers are defined:

Surface Layer: The interface between the water column and the atmosphere, extending to a depth of several centimeters, represents the surface of maximum exchange of atmospheric gases, heat and light. Surface films, floating vegetation and aggregations of materials or biota accumulate at this interface.

Upper Water Column: The area from just below the surface to the boundary of the pycnocline, if present. (If a pycnocline is not present or is not detected, the region above mid-depth in the water column is defined as the Upper Water Column.) The upper water column layer is in close contact with the atmosphere; usually oxygenated, well-mixed and well-lighted; and is generally marked by high rates of photosynthesis and net autotrophic production.

Pycnocline: The zone of maximum change of density of a particular physicochemical variable—normally salinity or temperature—that segregates two distinct layers, which are of relatively homogeneous density. The presence of a pycnocline provides a barrier to vertical mixing between the upper and lower water columns, and this layer enhances the stability of the water column.

Lower Water Column: The area below the pycnocline (or, if absent, below mid-depth in the water column), the lower portion of the water column is often dimly or negligibly illuminated (particularly in estuaries) and can be heterotrophic. These deeper waters have limited contact with the atmosphere, may be reduced in oxygen content, and can have a high degree of interaction with bottom sediments. This layer receives organic and mineral material from upper waters and is frequently the site of anoxia. In estuaries, the salt wedge and counter current flow occur in this layer.",2012-06,W,l

Water Column Component,Salinity Regime,,,,,CMECS Water Column Subcomponent,"Salinity in seawater results from a concentration of salts including bromine, iodine, and (principally) sodium chloride. Salinity is measured as a dimensionless conductivity ratio on the practical salinity scale (PSS), which was established by the IAPSO (International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans) in 1978 (UNESCO 1981). Most marine waters have salinities between 34 and 35, while in estuaries and coastal waters salinity can vary considerably from zero to hyperhaline (? 40). In estuaries, the salinity distribution is a function of direct precipitation, the influx of freshwater supplied by rivers, groundwater sources and runoff from the land and marine water supplied by exchange with the ocean as a function of tidal regime. Salinity is an indicator of the dynamic or conservative nature of mixing within the water body, and is one of the defining features of the structure of coastal waters. Most aquatic organisms function optimally within a narrow range of salinities, which has impact on the ecological balance and trophic structure of communities.

Water Column Component,Temperature Regime,,,,,CMECS Water Column Subcomponent,"Temperature is a measure of kinetic energy, and in most cases decreases with depth in the water column. The mean temperature of oceanic seawater, which by volume is principally at depth, is generally low, 0 – 5o C, but higher in the water column temperatures tend to converge toward air temperature at the surface. Marine waters are structured vertically with a mixed surface layer having little gradient in temperature, a thermocline with a highly variable gradient, and underlying waters with little stratification. A thermocline is established between an upper layer of one temperature and a lower layer of another and can be seasonal or permanent depending on the circulation and weather patterns. Pronounced thermoclines occur in the tropics, and essentially none occur in Polar Regions. In estuaries, temperatures are more variable because waters are shallower and under more influence of the temperature of inflowing freshwaters or of tidal marine waters. Temperature has a considerable impact on ecosystem functioning, affecting photosynthesis, growth, metabolism, and mobility of organisms. Rates of microbial processes of decomposition, nitrogen fixation and denitrification generally double with each increase of 10o C. Organisms tolerate a particular temperature range, and the temperature optimum range may span only a few degrees. The solubility of gases and pH are dependent on temperature, and temperature influences the ability of water to hold oxygen or oxic status.
Temperature categories are established in intervals of sufficient range and resolution to provide meaningful ecological differences yet yield a parsimonious number of categories. Temperature categories are based on the British Columbia Marine Ecological Classification for Canada (Howes, Harper, and Owens 1994, Zacharias et al. 1998, Resource Information Standards Committee 2002), modified to add the higher temperature ranges typical of the subtropics and tropics.

The Hydroform Subcomponent is a hierarchy of three levels consisting of Hydroform Classes, Hydroforms and Hydroform Types. Hydroforms are ecologically important because they shape their environment by creating gradients, surfaces, barriers, compartments and energy vectors. They strongly influence the distribution and condition of biota and often act as habitat by creating a complex environmental structure, by facilitating and enhancing transport of materials and energy, cycling nutrients, providing refugia, aggregating food resources, and providing migration paths. They influence the transfer of heat, salts, oxygen, carbon dioxide, trace elements, momentum, predicted trajectory, temporal persistence and associated fauna. Hydroforms vary extensively in size, volume, areal extent, persistence, and ecological significance.
In this standard hydroforms are represented conceptually as the average expression of their defining characteristics.

However, all currents have features in common: the advective movement and transport of water, constituents (such as particulates and dissolved compounds), qualities (such as temperature and salinity) and biota (such as plankton, nekton, and megafauna). Currents are driven by gravity flow, geostrophic flow, density differences, hydraulic differential or energy input. They may be isolated from land and freely flowing in the water column as is the Gulf Stream, or they may be in channelized flow or long-shore flow.

Nonetheless, strong circulation and water motion occurs in the aquatic system under the ice (driven by advection of adjacent water masses or thermal convection). Because freshwater freezes at a higher temperature than salt water, surface freezing of the ocean concentrates salt brine in the liquid water below the ice. Ice formation and ice cover maintenance is relatively stable in both spatial and temporal terms, determined by relative air and water temperatures, velocity of water movements, and geomorphology of the setting.",2012-06,W,h3.4

This occurrence affects biota in the water column, as well as bottom and shore substrates and biota. The surf zone is highly variable temporally and spatially in extent, energy characteristics, and physicochemical properties; this variability is due to the tight coupling between the water column and the substrate it impacts. In areas of soft sediments, high turbidity can result.

Modifiers,Biological Modifers,Community Successional Stage,,,,CMECS Modifier,"The Community Successional Stage modifier is intended for use in the Biotic Component, Faunal Bed Class, Soft-sediment Fauna Subclass. In the ecological literature, successional stage is a concept used to characterize identifiable points along a continuum of sequential—and somewhat predictable—replacements of taxa following a major disturbance which opens up a relatively large space. These stages are based in part on the differing organism life-history strategies of biota, and in part on their resulting modifications to the physical environment (Odum 1969; Ritter, Montagna, and Applebaum 2005). Rosenberg (1976) pointed out that the same basic pattern of succession is seen in soft-sediment environments in many different parts of the world, in response to various stressors (e.g., organic input, temperature stress, or low oxygen), noting that species composition (but not the basic pattern) differs among settings. Early work on infaunal marine succession recognized that this process is a complex and continually varying response to a history of disturbance, and that “there is a complete spectrum in nature” (Johnson 1972). Nonetheless, there is (along this spectrum) a predictable pattern to benthic community structure that follows levels of stress and disturbance, and this is a very useful construct in understanding the environment (Rosenberg 2001). CMECS provides four modifiers for Community Stage in soft-sediment areas; these have been described previously (Pearson and Rosenberg 1976, 1978; Rhoads and Germano 1982, 1986; Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) and are shown in Figure 10.1.",2012-06,,CSS

Modifiers,Biological Modifers,Invertebrate Community Organism Size,,,,CMECS Modifier,"The Invertebrate Community Organism Size modifier is intended for use in the Biotic Component, Faunal Bed Class. Ecological theory of community succession and disturbance posits that less frequently disturbed environments will provide the stability to support longer-lived communities of larger organisms, while frequently disturbed environments will be characterized by smaller and shorter-lived organisms. Faunal Bed communities are often complex, with a wide range of individual organisms and species occurring in many sizes to fill a variety of ecological niches. CMECS provides a coarse set of Organism Size Modifiers to describe Faunal Bed communities through sizes of the larger organisms that are evident in an observational unit. Many different methods have historically been proposed to distinguish macrofauna from megafauna—ranging from “visible to the unassisted eye,” to retention on various screen sizes, to inclusion only of
much larger organisms. The CMECS criterion used to identify megafauna is a body size > 1 cm (in the smallest dimension).

The depth of the aRPD is easily measured, and it has been found to be an extremely useful parameter in characterizing certain biogeochemical aspects of the sedimentary environment. For instance, the aRPD represents the depth at which iron exists as colored, insoluble, ferric hydroxides, which dissolve into solution as iron monosulfides in a reducing environment, e.g., in the presence of sulfate reduction (Teal et al. 2009).
The aRPD is strongly correlated to the true RPD depth (Grizzle and Penniman 1991; Rosenberg et al. 2001), which is the depth where Eh (measured sediment reduction/oxidation potential) is zero. Both values are very useful as proxies for bioturbation (because the values are extended deeper by the effects of bioturbating fauna), and both are correlated to bottom-water dissolved-oxygen concentration (Rosenberg 1977; Diaz, Cutter, and Rhoads 1994; Cicchetti et al. 2006). The aRPD can be measured with a variety of techniques including retrieval of cores, sediment profile imaging, and direct observation. The RPD can be measured using microelectrodes, either in retrieved cores or <in situ>.

RPD (centimeters) – The RPD is measured with electrodes, and is reported in centimeters.
aRPD depth (centimeters), muddy sediments – The aRPD depth is measured at the color transition based on direct observation or from images, and it can be reported in centimeters or following the terms defined below (from Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997). These modifier terms apply only to sediments that contain some mud; aRPD depths manifest differently in sand sediments that are dominated by different diffusional processes and rates.",2012-06,,RPD

While turbidity is frequently reported in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTUs), CMECS establishes categories for turbidity based on Secchi disk depth; it would be difficult to standardize turbidity by NTUs due to regional variations in background measurements.

Modifiers,Physicochemical Modifiers,Water Column Stability Regime,,,,CMECS Modifier,"Water column stability can be characterized as stratified, partially mixed, and well-mixed. This structure is defined by density differentials from bottom to surface, as shown in the table below. Water Column Stability is assessed using the more universally applied delta Sigma-t to calculate stability, which incorporates salinity, temperature into the calculation of density and adjusts for adiabatic effects (Pond and Pickard 1983). The Stability Regime modifier compares the calculated ? Sigma-t, or the relative density of two water parcels by subtraction of the density of the surface layer from the density of the deeper layer. If the density difference equals or exceeds 0.125, the water column is considered to be vertically stable; if it differs by less than 0.125, and density is homogeneous between the upper and lower layers, the water column is classified as well-mixed. If the density difference is less than 0.125 and variable between the two layers, the water column is classified as partially mixed.",2012-06,,WCS

Modifiers,Spatial Modifers,Co-occurring Elements,Descriptive,,,CMECS Modifier,"Nature is inherently a mixture or a continuum. CMECS provides an ecologically meaningful methodology to classify nature into discrete environmental types using consistent threshold values that define primary classification units. However, in natural coastal and marine settings, less abundant, co-occurring (or secondary) features are frequently mixed into these primary classification types at some level beneath a classification threshold. Therefore, these co-occurring features are not recognized in the syntax of the primary classification. In some situations, project goals may require identification of these co-occurring features and associated taxa. In other situations, identification of co-occurring materials, taxa, or mixes may detract from project goals.
CMECS provides a modifier, Co-occurring Elements, for identification of secondary CMECS classification units that are mixed into a primary classification unit at a level below the classification threshold. Co-occurring Elements are used in the hierarchical Biotic and Substrate Components when the primary feature and the co-occurring feature are both units in that same Component.

The upper 15 centimeters of substrate may present as a set of horizontal layers constituting a three-dimensional matrix. A basic identification of horizontal substrate layers can be accomplished by describing the characteristics of these layers and recording the mean thickness in centimeters together with the ordering of each layer below the sediment surface. The process of identifying and describing substrate layers can provide ecological insights and practical value for users interested in substrate structure and process, as well as in ecological history.
The structuring of distinctly layered sediments is captured in CMECS as a modifier using any SC classifiers, modifiers, or descriptors in the following format, with measurements indicating thickness or depth of the examined layers (as specified).
