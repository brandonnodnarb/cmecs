Biogeographic Setting,,,,CMECS Setting: Biogeographic Setting,"The CMECS Biogeographic Setting is adopted from the Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW) technique (Spalding et al, 2007) for characterizing bioregions of marine coastal and shelf environments. MEOW provides global coverage with a nested, three-tiered system of realms, provinces, and ecoregions (moving from larger-scale to smaller-scale units). CMECS proposes to use the MEOW realms, provinces, and ecoregions for describing biogeographic elements of the Estuarine System and the Marine Nearshore and Offshore Subsystems.",2012-06,E,
