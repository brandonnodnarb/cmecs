Modifiers,,,,CMECS Modifiers,"Modifiers are physicochemical, spatial, geological, biological, anthropogenic, and temporal variables with defined categorical values and ranges that are used to describe CMECS units. Modifiers can be applied when additional information is needed to further characterize an identified unit for individual applications. Modifiers provide additional environmental, structural, or biological information about the ecosystem; modifiers are useful for description and application- but they are not required for classification according to the CMECS schema. Modifiers are a dynamic component of the CMECS in the sense that users are free to apply additional local modifiers for their project needs as long as these are reported and do not conflict with modifiers outlined in this section.
The modifiers are organized by into general modifier types, and then listed alphabetically within the given type for easy reference. The general modifier types include Anthropogenic, Biogeographic, Biological, Physical, Physicochemical, Spatial, and Temporal.",2012-06,,

Modifiers,Biological Modifers,Community Successional Stage,,CMECS Modifier,"The Community Successional Stage modifier is intended for use in the Biotic Component, Faunal Bed Class, Soft-sediment Fauna Subclass. In the ecological literature, successional stage is a concept used to characterize identifiable points along a continuum of sequential—and somewhat predictable—replacements of taxa following a major disturbance which opens up a relatively large space. These stages are based in part on the differing organism life-history strategies of biota, and in part on their resulting modifications to the physical environment (Odum 1969; Ritter, Montagna, and Applebaum 2005). Rosenberg (1976) pointed out that the same basic pattern of succession is seen in soft-sediment environments in many different parts of the world, in response to various stressors (e.g., organic input, temperature stress, or low oxygen), noting that species composition (but not the basic pattern) differs among settings. Early work on infaunal marine succession recognized that this process is a complex and continually varying response to a history of disturbance, and that “there is a complete spectrum in nature” (Johnson 1972). Nonetheless, there is (along this spectrum) a predictable pattern to benthic community structure that follows levels of stress and disturbance, and this is a very useful construct in understanding the environment (Rosenberg 2001). CMECS provides four modifiers for Community Stage in soft-sediment areas; these have been described previously (Pearson and Rosenberg 1976, 1978; Rhoads and Germano 1982, 1986; Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) and are shown in Figure 10.1.",2012-06,,CSS
Modifiers,Biological Modifers,Community Successional Stage,Stage 0,CMECS Modifier Value,"These oligozoic soft-sediment areas show little evidence of multi-cellular life; however, benthic samples that are retrieved and processed under magnification from Stage 0 stations will generally produce low numbers of small macrofauna or meiofauna. Multicellular fauna will not be obvious to the unassisted eye when examining sediment, and it will not be obvious in high-resolution images of the seafloor. Bacterial mats may be present. If examining sediment profile images, guidelines from Rhoads and Germano (1982, 1986) can be followed or the Nilsson-Rosenberg BHQ metrics (Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) can be used (BHQ values for Stage 0 will range from 0 to 1.99). No evidence of active bioturbation exists, and aRPD depths are typically < 2 millimeters.",2012-06,,CSS01
Modifiers,Biological Modifers,Community Successional Stage,Stage 1,CMECS Modifier Value,"These associations are inhabited by small opportunistic fauna (e.g., capitellids and spionids) in the upper centimeter of sediment. Larger fauna are not present, although juvenile individuals of larger species may occur. Names of small, opportunistic local species typical of Stage 1 are available in the regional literature. Surface expressions include small tubes (< 2 millimeters in diameter) of polychaetes or other fauna, or evidence of oligochaete burrowing activities. Subsurface evidence of either small worms or small burrow structures will primarily occur in the upper centimeter of sediment. If examining sediment profile images, guidelines from Rhoads and Germano (1982, 1986) can be followed or the Nilsson-Rosenberg BHQ metrics (Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) can be used (Stage 1 BHQ values will range from 2 to < 5).

Modifiers,Biological Modifers,Community Successional Stage,Stage 2,CMECS Modifier Value,"Communities are characterized by fauna of intermediate sizes typically inhabiting the upper 2-4 centimeters of sediment. This stage is considered transitional and is often variable; in a percentage of samples it will be difficult to clearly distinguish Stage 2 from other stages within the continuous spectrum presented by natural environments. Regional literature identifying species typical of Stage 2 may be referenced. Surface evidence of Stage 2 communities includes openings to small burrows (defined as excavations with a lumen width < 1 centimeter) and the presence of mid-sized tube dwelling fauna (e.g., robust Ampelisca tube mats; tubes > 2 millimeters in diameter; or tubes longer than 30 millimeters if very thin). Subsurface evidence includes burrows of polychaetes or other fauna in the upper 2-4 centimeters of sediment, small shallow-dwelling opportunistic bivalves, and small feeding voids in the upper 4 centimeters of sediment. If examining sediment profile images, guidelines from Rhoads and Germano (1982, 1986) can be followed or the Nilsson-Rosenberg BHQ metrics (Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) can be used (BHQ for Stage 2 will range from 5 to 10).",2012-06,,CSS03
Modifiers,Biological Modifers,Community Successional Stage,Stage 3,CMECS Modifier Value,"These communities are identified by larger, long-lived, deep burrowing fauna or by evidence of the activities of those fauna; burrowing activities typically extend deeper than 5 centimeters. Characteristic species vary among localities and among environments; species can be identified through regionally appropriate literature. Common surface expression may include very large tube-building fauna (> 3 millimeters in diameter or > 30 mm in length), larger fecal mounds, burrowing urchins or ophiuroids, pits or tunnel openings (e.g., crustacean excavations with a lumen width of > 1 centimeter), or large digging spoils associated with pits or tunnels. Subsurface characteristics include oxygenated or active faunal feeding voids at 5 centimeters or deeper, active tunnels (subsurface excavations with a lumen width of > 1 centimeter) at depth, or presence of large polychaetes or other fauna. Frequently, evidence of smaller, opportunistic fauna will also be present in Stage 3 communities; these fauna are not necessarily eliminated by larger fauna. If evaluating sediment profile images, guidelines from Rhoads and Germano (1982, 1986) can be followed, or the Nilsson-Rosenberg Benthic Habitat Quality (BHQ) metric (Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) can be used (Stage 3 will have BHQ > 10). Extensive bioturbation will be evidenced by deep RPD and aRPD depths.",2012-06,,CSS04
Modifiers,Biological Modifers,Invertebrate Community Organism Size,,CMECS Modifier,"The Invertebrate Community Organism Size modifier is intended for use in the Biotic Component, Faunal Bed Class. Ecological theory of community succession and disturbance posits that less frequently disturbed environments will provide the stability to support longer-lived communities of larger organisms, while frequently disturbed environments will be characterized by smaller and shorter-lived organisms. Faunal Bed communities are often complex, with a wide range of individual organisms and species occurring in many sizes to fill a variety of ecological niches. CMECS provides a coarse set of Organism Size Modifiers to describe Faunal Bed communities through sizes of the larger organisms that are evident in an observational unit. Many different methods have historically been proposed to distinguish macrofauna from megafauna—ranging from “visible to the unassisted eye,” to retention on various screen sizes, to inclusion only of
much larger organisms. The CMECS criterion used to identify megafauna is a body size > 1 cm (in the smallest dimension). Importantly, this modifier describes the defining, significant, or dominant organisms that best characterize a community, recognizing that most communities include a variety of organisms that occur in both large and small individual sizes.",2012-06,,ICO

Moreover, the depth of the shift from photic to aphotic occurs at different points in the water column, depending on the ecosystem, watershed, and suspended substances reducing water clarity.

Modifiers,Physicochemical Modifiers,aRPD and RPD Depth,,CMECS Modifier,"The apparent Redox Potential Discontinuity (aRPD) is a measurement of the depth of the “color break,” that is, the maximum color difference below the sediment-water interface at which lighter-colored (tan, brown, beige, yellow, or red), more-oxidized surface sediments transition into darker-colored (grey, black, or blue-black), more-reduced deeper sediments. The depth of the aRPD is easily measured, and it has been found to be an extremely useful parameter in characterizing certain biogeochemical aspects of the sedimentary environment. For instance, the aRPD represents the depth at which iron exists as colored, insoluble, ferric hydroxides, which dissolve into solution as iron monosulfides in a reducing environment, e.g., in the presence of sulfate reduction (Teal et al. 2009).
The aRPD is strongly correlated to the true RPD depth (Grizzle and Penniman 1991; Rosenberg et al. 2001), which is the depth where Eh (measured sediment reduction/oxidation potential) is zero. Both values are very useful as proxies for bioturbation (because the values are extended deeper by the effects of bioturbating fauna), and both are correlated to bottom-water dissolved-oxygen concentration (Rosenberg 1977; Diaz, Cutter, and Rhoads 1994; Cicchetti et al. 2006). The aRPD can be measured with a variety of techniques including retrieval of cores, sediment profile imaging, and direct observation. The RPD can be measured using microelectrodes, either in retrieved cores or <in situ>.

RPD (centimeters) – The RPD is measured with electrodes, and is reported in centimeters.

Coarse Percent Cover can be described using one of five coarse descriptors, e.g., ""Sparse"", or, if greater detail is needed, Fine Percent Cover can be described using one of eleven range categories, e.g., ""10 to < 20%"".",2012-06,,PC

Modifiers,Spatial Modifers,Substrate Layering,Descriptive,CMECS Modifier,"Substrate in CMECS conceptually extends to the greatest depth that supports multicellular life. Although certain large fauna may penetrate several meters below the surface in soft sediments, CMECS generally considers the uppermost 15 centimeters of fine substrates, recognizing that evidence of very-deep burrowing fauna will also be present in the top 15 centimeters. The upper 15 centimeters of substrate may present as a set of horizontal layers constituting a three-dimensional matrix. A basic identification of horizontal substrate layers can be accomplished by describing the characteristics of these layers and recording the mean thickness in centimeters together with the ordering of each layer below the sediment surface. The process of identifying and describing substrate layers can provide ecological insights and practical value for users interested in substrate structure and process, as well as in ecological history.
The structuring of distinctly layered sediments is captured in CMECS as a modifier using any SC classifiers, modifiers, or descriptors in the following format, with measurements indicating thickness or depth of the examined layers (as specified). The term “veneer"" may be used to describe a thin (< 1 centimeter thick) covering of one sediment type over another sediment type. Examples can be found on page 219.",2012-06,,SL
