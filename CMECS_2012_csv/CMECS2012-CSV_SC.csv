Substrate Component,,,,,,CMECS Component: Substrate ,"Substrate is defined in CMECS as the non-living materials that form an aquatic bottom or seafloor, or that provide a surface (e.g., floating objects, buoys) for growth of attached biota. Substrate may be composed of any substance, natural or manmade. Describing the composition of the substrate is a fundamental part of any ecological classification scheme. Substrate provides context and setting for many aquatic processes, and it provides living space for benthic and attached biota. The Substrate Component (SC) is a characterization of the composition and particle size of the surface layers of the substrate; this component is designed to be compatible with a range of sampling tools. The SC provides guidance to characterize the layers of substrate that support the majority of multicellular life – the upper layer of hard substrate, or (typically) the upper 15 centimeters of soft substrate – in a way that is consistent with a variety of past practices. The SC and the BC describe the non-living (SC) and living (BC) aspects of a plan-view perspective of the seafloor at comparable scales. SC observational unit scales range from sediment corers or grabs, to sediment profile or plan-view photographs of the seafloor, to defined quadrats or transects, to video clips, to high-resolution acoustic images. At larger scales, the structure, shape, and surface pattern of substrate features are described by the Geoform Component (GC).",2012-06,S,

These units are derived from Wentworth (1922), and they can be broken down into Wentworth grain size classes for greater precision, if desired. Biogenic Substrate classifications may be based on percent weight (e.g., for retrieved samples); percent cover (e.g., for plan-view images); and visual percent composition (for other approaches). The terms ""dominant"" and ""primarily"" in the Biogenic Substrate Origin describe the substrate type that is present in the greatest percent cover, greatest percent weight, or greatest visual percent composition. When two Biogenic Substrate types are present, ""dominant"" and ""primarily"" are equivalent to ""> 50%"".

Substrate Component,Anthropogenic Substrate,,,,,CMECS Component: Substrate Component Origin,"Substrates where percent cover of Anthropogenic Substrate exceeds percent cover of both Geologic Substrate and Biogenic Substrates, considered separately. Anthropogenic Substrates are classified at the higher levels by composition, and at the lower levels by median particle size, using the units Reef Substrate (? 4,096 millimeters), Rubble (64 millimeters to < 4,096 millimeters), Hash (2 millimeters to < 64 millimeters), Sand (0.0625 millimeters to < 2 millimeters), and Mud (< 0.0625 millimeters). These units are derived from Wentworth (1922), and can be broken down into Wentworth grain size classes for greater precision if desired. Shape for this substrate origin is covered in the GC, but practitioners may choose to add further descriptors in a comment or notes field. Anthropogenic Substrate classifications may be based on percent weight (e.g., for retrieved samples); percent cover (e.g., for plan-view images); and visual percent composition (for other approaches). The terms ""dominant"" and ""primarily"" in the Anthropogenic Substrate Origin describe the substrate type that is present in the greatest percent cover, greatest percent weight, or greatest visual percent composition. When two Anthropogenic Substrate types are present, ""dominant"" and ""primarily"" are equivalent to ""> 50%"". When three or more types exist, the dominant type may occur at a lower percent-of-total value. When Anthropogenic Substrate is present, but does not constitute the dominant substrate, it should be included as a Co-occurring Element Modifier.",2012-06,S,3
